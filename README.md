# falling sand

* this is a first attempt at a falling sand simulation using SFML
* I might want to try using Metal at some point
* I usually use Processing for this kind of thing but I wanted to improve my C++

# development

1. install sfml with homebrew
2. run `cmake ..` in a build directory
3. `make`
